The file `HH_plane.txt` is provided to verify the computations included in the article "Postulation of lines in P^3 revisited", compatible with SINGULAR version 4.4.0.
The file `HH_plane_search.txt` create a list of all possible residual subschemes for given initial configuration B(d,L,C,(A,B))

This file contains all computations performed in the reduction lemma, covering both the even and odd cases. It also displays all trace and residual schemes for the case B(9;14,4,4,2).
